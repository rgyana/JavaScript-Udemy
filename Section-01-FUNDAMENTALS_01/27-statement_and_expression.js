/** @format */

//EXPRESSION : An expression is a piece of code that produces a value
/* for example-
    3 + 4 : it produces some value
    1991 : because its a value
    true && false && !false
*/

/* STATEMENT: The statement is like a bigger piece of code that is executed and which soes not produces a value on itself. */
/* basically we write our whole programs as a sequence of actions and these actions are statement */

// Ex-1
if (23 > 18) {
  const str = "23 is bigger";
}

// in template variable we can only insert expression, but not statement.
const me = "Gyana";
console.log(`I am ${2037 - 1991} years old ${me}`);
